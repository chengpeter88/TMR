- Streamlit Lecture 4 Warning -

I have noticed that some of the packages used in the Streamlit lecture are outdated. However, the author intentionally used the older versions to demonstrate specific methods without encountering any errors. Here are some suggestions to ensure smooth execution:

1. If you are using the latest version of Python, such as Python 3.11, it is recommended to downgrade to Python 3.9 or 3.8. This is because the Gensim package may not be compatible with the newer versions of Python.

To install Gensim version 3.8.2, you can use the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```shell
pip install gensim==3.8.2
```

This will install Gensim version 3.8.2 specifically.

2. It is important to note that the commands `streamlit.beta_expander` and `streamlit.beta_columns` mentioned in the lecture are no longer supported. The updated commands are `streamlit.expander` and `streamlit.columns` respectively. Please make sure to use the correct commands in your code.

3. The package `spacy` has also been updated. Instead of using `spacy.load('en')`, you should now use `spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')`. Before using this command, ensure that you have already installed the package by running the following command:

```shell
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

This command will download the English language model to your local machine.

4. Lastly, for other packages, you can either use the latest version with `pip install`, or if you prefer using conda, you can use `conda install` to install and manage the packages.

I hope these optimizations and clarifications help you navigate the Streamlit Lecture 4 more effectively. If you have any further questions or need assistance with Python or any other topic, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
