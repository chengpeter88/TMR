- Streamlit Lecture 4 Warning 

I have noticed that some of the packages used in the Streamlit lecture are outdated. However, the author intentionally used the older versions to demonstrate specific methods without encountering any errors. Here are some suggestions to ensure smooth execution:

If you are using the latest version of Python, such as Python 3.11, it is recommended to downgrade to Python 3.9 or 3.8. This is because the Gensim package may not be compatible with the newer versions of Python.

It is important to note that the summarization module in Gensim has been removed since version 3.8. Hence, the newer versions of Gensim do not support text summarization.
